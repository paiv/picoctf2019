This is a unique challenge. To try not to spoil it I'd reccomend trying to
examine the packets in more detail. There's a unique way that data is being
hidden

Keep looking. See if you can piece together information from outside the
streams. Timing kind of matters. Order does too.

BTW, the "start" packet matters a lot.

You only need wireshark. Maybe look into how packets work.

What purpose does each packet serve in a standard network?

It's not in the UDP, it's _of_ the UDP. Better Hint: ASCII

the Flag is There in Plain sight, within a very specific stream based off of a
respective port. good luck
